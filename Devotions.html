    <h2>Devotions</h2>
    <p>God has been an important part of our lives. I have to say many times I wonder if He is near.  Life is full of challenges and it seems that no matter how best I try to plan things to cover all the bases, things never go the way I want.  It's worst when I constantly feel the domino effect of things going awry and wonder when it will slow down enough for me to just sit and breathe. </p>

    <p>I have to always remind myself that just because I'm a follower of Christ and that He's my Lord and Savior, it doesn't mean He's going to stop each and every negative, unplanned, unexpected event from happening in my life.  People always say to be careful what you ask God for; it's like if you ask for patience, He won't just "snap" His fingers and voila, you're instantly a very patient person.  God works in mysterious ways.  The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+55%3A8-9&version=KJV" target="blank">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, "For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, saith the Lord.  For as the Heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts." </p>

    <p>God is the creator of this world and each and every one of us.  He knew us even before we were born (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+139%3A13-16&version=NKJV" target="blank">Psalm 139:13)</a>.  He knows our likes and dislikes.  He is always around, even when our lives seem like it's in constant turmoil and we feel like we're the only person going through life in a "dark cloud".</p>  

    <p>If we allow ourselves, we can see God's love and faithfulness all the time and experience His joy and peace that transcends above all understanding <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A7&version=NKJV" target="blank">(Philippians 4:7)</a>.  We must allow ourselves to slow down enough to embrace His presence.  From the birth of each beautiful life, whether it's a child, animal, insect, or plant, to the consistency in the seasons: from the beautiful autumn colors of the changing leaves followed by the chills and sparkling magnificence of the snow covered grounds, to the blooming of life in spring as evidenced in the trees, birds, flowers, and followed by the wonderful summer warmth to the miracles individuals experience that can only be from God such as being healed from a "terminal" illness, getting over a long-time addiction, or helped financially when no one else knew of the need.  Through each day, each season, each year, each miracle, each encouragement, He reminds us that no matter how hard or bleak things get, He is always there for us and He will help us get through the difficult times <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+46%3A4&version=NKJV" target="blank">(Isaiah 46:4)</a>.<p>  

    <p>We live in a world where we want things instantly. We want to be cured from illnesses instantly, we want our retirement nest-egg to "grow" quickly and instantly so that we can retire as soon as possible, we want to be at the top in our careers immediately, we want to be first in whatever comes our way.  It's hard not to want that when we're surrounded by it all the time.  Television shows, movies, technology make life seem simple, easy, and quick when it really isn't. I have learned many times (and still am whenever life's challenges come my way--more frequent than I care for) that that is not God's way.  He is in control.  He knows who is on His side and who isn't (but can/will be). He knows who is and who will be giving us grief. Constantly, I have to go to Him in prayer to help me through my situations so that "the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart is pleasing to Him" <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+19%3A14&version=NKJV" target="blank">(Psalm 19:14)</a>.  I have to keep my thoughts and temperament by focusing on Him and what He wants from me, such as to think about what is true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, anything that is excellent or praiseworthy <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A8&version=NKJV" target="blank">(Philippians 4:8)</a>.  By doing this, I know the most dreary, depressing, and bleakest of things will not be dreadful at all because He will get me through this situation just as He has with previous situations, as long as I let Him and not try to take control of it, especially if His way is not my way and His timing is not in my timing.</p>
